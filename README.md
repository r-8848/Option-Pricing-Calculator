# Option Pricing Calculator

## Introduction

Welcome to the Option Pricing Calculator! This Django web application allows you to calculate the price of call and put options for stocks using different models. You can choose between the Two-Step Binomial Model, the N-Step Binomial Model, and the Black-Scholes Model to perform your calculations.

## Features

- **Two-Step Binomial Model**: Calculates option prices using a two-step binomial tree.
- **N-Step Binomial Model**: Allows you to specify the number of steps for a more detailed calculation.
- **Black-Scholes Model**: Uses the Black-Scholes formula to calculate option prices.
